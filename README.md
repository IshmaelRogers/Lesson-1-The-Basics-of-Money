# Lesson 1
## The Basics of Money

### Introduction

In this lesson, we're going to go over the basics of money. This includes going over what it is, why do we use it, and how to identify it. As we know, money is something that we use to buy the things we want and the things we need. In more technical terms, money serves as an exchange medium, a form of payment, and a store of value. Money is also known as fiat money, currency, or monetary units. Let's look at some examples. 
#### If little Billy goes shopping with his mother and sees a pair of shoes that he wants, how do you think he's going to get them?
Yes, he can go through several different methods of persuading his mom to purchase them for him, but truthfully, the only way little Billy is going to get those pair of shoes is if he purchases them with a form of payment. This form of payment can be Cash, a Debit or Credit Card, or some other form of electronic currency if available.
#### What happens if we take $100 (STOPPED HERE)

Money has value because, in a physical sense, time does not cause it to age, or decay. 

### Precious Metals
#### For example, let's say we have one gold U.S. Dollar Coin ($1USD) and a slice of cheese. Now let's say that we left the dollar and cheese on the kitchen counter for a week. What do you think happened? 
Logically, when we observe the differences in the physical state of the coin and cheese after a week, the coin will still be in almost the same physical condition as it was a week ago, whereas, the cheese will be more than likely gross looking and no longer in the same physical state. This is because money is manmade and because of that we give it value through usage. 

### Cryptocurrency
#### Are you familiar with BitCoin?
BitCoin is the one of the most popular forms of cryptocurrency used for exchange. Cyptocurrency is basically a form of electronic or digital cash. It's pretty simple to use too. Once you convert your U.S. dollars into cryptocurrency, you can use it in similar ways that you would use physical money.** Last year, in 2017, the value of BitCoin has fluctuated from almost $20k at the top of the year to nearly $3k by the end of the year. That is due to depreciation or inflation.
