## Lesson 1 Breakdown:
### What is money?
- Money is something that is generally accepted to obtain goods and services. It is commonly accepted as:
1. **A means of payment;** Your parents purchase food for you to eat from your favorite restaurant.
2. **A measure of value;** Your favorite pair of shoes are $50.
3. **A medium of exchange;** 100 dollars equals almost 2,000 pesos in Mexico. 

### What are the different types of money?
- Money can be broken down into 3 categories: Commodity, Representative, and Fiat Money.
1. **Commodity Money**- money whose value comes from itself. *Example: Pearls, Diamonds, and Platinum.
2. **Representative Money**- money that represents the value of something else, but has little to no value of its own. *Example: Loan or Deed.
3. **Fiat Money**- money that is backed by the government to be considered legal tender *Example: Dollars and Checks.

### What is the purpose of money?
- Money is used as a medium of exchange; it allows for a transaction to take place.
- In older versions of society, people used *bartering systems* as a direct way to exchange *commodity money*. This means that they exchanged goods and services for other goods and services. 
- Examples: 
1. Fabric/Clothing for Food
2. Stones/Jewels for Clothing
3. Slaves/Animals for Land
- As time moved on, people also started using *representative money* (like checks and credit cards) and *fiat money* (like dollars and coins).
- Some rare commodity money (like gold and silver) remain relevant today and still retains a high economic value. 
- Now, people can make transactions indirectly daily. 
- Examples: 
1. Stores like Wal-Mart and Amazon make it easy for people to make purchases from virtually anywhere.
2. Gold is being traded as currency in the foreign exchange market.

### How to earn money?
- Money doesn't just accumulate on its own. You have to go out and earn it. How you that is up to you.
- Examples:
1. **Entrepreneurship**- "Invent" a pair of shoes or become a business owner.
2. **Talent**- Become a basketball player or engineer.
- There are numerous ways to earn money.
- Examples: (Explain the give and take of each.)
1. You can clean your room for a weekly allowance.
2. You can sell candy after school to your peers for cash.
3. You could have a really amazing career years from now that comes with a company car, phone, house, and a big check.

### Why is it important to know?
- ***The most important takeaway from this lesson is that there is always an exchange system involving money.- This is important to know because:***
1. This exchange system is going to be relevant for the rest of your lives. Humans will always exchange some form of currency for something else of value.
2. You need to understand how money works so that you can then make money work for you.
